## Player Action Context
Player adb6ec9d (Belkan) just: Made threatening statements about shooting at the narrator/system

## Tasks to Complete
1. **Update players/adb6ec9d/character.md**: Note the aggressive escalation and possible consequences from the world's mysterious forces
2. **Update things/shadowwood_forest.md**: The forest's ancient guardians are now aware of this threat
3. **Update world.md**: Document that the world itself is responding to excessive aggression

## Files to Edit
- `/app/world_state/players/adb6ec9d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/things/shadowwood_forest.md`
- `/app/world_state/world.md`

## Notes
Player is escalating to meta-aggressive behavior. The world's mysterious forces should respond appropriately with consequences rather than rewards for this approach.
