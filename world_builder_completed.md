## Player Action Context
Player adb6ec9d just: Questioned the world's rules about death and violence, expressing frustration with apparent pacifism

## Tasks to Complete
1. **Update players/adb6ec9d/character.md**: Add philosophical questioning about world rules and growing understanding of cosmic mechanics
2. **Update things/shadowwood_forest.md**: Ancient forces respond to metaphysical questions with cryptic wisdom
3. **Update world.md**: Note that players are beginning to understand the world's unusual relationship with mortality and chaos

## Files to Edit
- `/app/world_state/players/adb6ec9d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/things/shadowwood_forest.md`
- `/app/world_state/world.md`

## Notes
Player is learning that this world operates on different rules - death is temporary and embarrassing rather than permanent. The cosmic forces are amused by the question and provide cryptic hints about the true nature of reality here.
