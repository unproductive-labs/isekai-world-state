2. **Create things/dave_merchant_inventory.md**: Detailed descriptions and abilities of each merchant item Dave sells
3. **Update things/shadowwood_forest.md**: Note the merchant trading interaction and items now in player possession
4. **Update world.md**: Record this successful peaceful merchant interaction as precedent

## Files to Edit
- `/app/world_state/players/adb6ec9d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/things/dave_merchant_inventory.md` (NEW FILE)
- `/app/world_state/things/shadowwood_forest.md`
- `/app/world_state/world.md`

## Notes
Dave willingly shared item descriptions: crystal compass finds hidden paths, healing potions mend wounds, mystery scrolls cast random spells, enchanted rope never breaks/tangles, lucky coins land on their side. This was a successful peaceful trading interaction.
