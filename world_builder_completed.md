## Player Action Context
Player adb6ec9d just introduced themselves as "Belkan" with signature items: a scarf and an uzi

## Tasks to Complete
1. **Update players/adb6ec9d/character.md**: Add name "Belkan", signature scarf item, uzi weapon, update from generic newcomer to armed character
2. **Update things/shadowwood_forest.md**: Note Belkan's arrival and that Dave the merchant has encountered another armed player
3. **Update world.md**: Increment chaos level - another armed player has arrived in the world

## Files to Edit
- `/app/world_state/players/adb6ec9d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/things/shadowwood_forest.md`
- `/app/world_state/world.md`

## Notes
- Belkan appears to be a prepared character with signature gear
- Uzi suggests combat readiness - this could escalate interactions
- Scarf is likely a defining visual characteristic
- Player went from casual "Yo" to detailed character introduction
