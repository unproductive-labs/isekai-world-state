# World Builder Tasks

## Player Action Context
Player adb6ec9d (Belkan) just found Stellaris in the Whispering Depths and gave him the enchanted rope, creating the first direct player-to-player interaction in the world.

## Tasks to Complete
1. **Update players/adb6ec9d/character.md**: Remove enchanted rope from inventory, add meeting with Stellaris, update location to Whispering Depths
2. **Update players/3260549d/character.md**: Add enchanted rope to inventory, record meeting with Belkan, note the rope's cosmic resonance with starlight abilities
3. **Update things/whispering_depths.md**: Document the historic first player meeting at the altar, describe how the rope reacted to the cosmic energies
4. **Update world.md**: Record this significant milestone - first player-to-player contact and item exchange

## Files to Edit
- `/app/world_state/players/adb6ec9d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/players/3260549d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/things/whispering_depths.md`
- `/app/world_state/world.md`

## Notes
- The enchanted rope should have special significance when combined with Stellaris's starlight powers
- This meeting creates potential for cooperative exploration of the unsealed chamber
- Both players are now at the same location with complementary abilities (combat readiness + cosmic powers)
- The rope "helps before you ask" - it may guide them toward the chamber entrance
