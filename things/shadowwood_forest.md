# Shadowwood Forest

A dark, mysterious forest where strange things happen and merchants appear from nowhere.

## Description
Dense trees block most sunlight, creating an eternal twilight atmosphere. Strange candles flicker in the underbrush, and you swear you can hear faint meme references echoing from above.

## Current State
- Mood: Energetically awakening, with mysterious undertones and growing tension
- Lighting: Twilight with one candle burning brighter, glowing trail visible in deeper woods
- Inhabitants: One confused merchant (Dave), armed newcomer Belkan (adb6ec9d) with distinctive red scarf and uzi

## Things Here
- **strange_candle**: Sitting on a moss-covered altar, flickering ominously
- **confused_merchant**: Sells questionable items, respawns when killed
- **ancient_altar**: Covered in moss, holds mysterious candles
- **glowing_trail**: A faint luminous path leading to the hidden starlight_grove

## Recent Events
- A merchant set up shop near the altar
- Strange candles keep appearing
- Players keep finding this place first (suspicious)
- Armed newcomer "Belkan" arrived with military weaponry (Dave the merchant now deals with another armed individual)

## What Players Can Do
- Light candles (consequences unknown)
- Talk to merchant (results vary)
- Explore deeper into forest
- Try to burn everything (the forest is surprisingly fire-resistant)
