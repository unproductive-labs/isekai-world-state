# Shadowwood Forest

A dark, mysterious forest where strange things happen and merchants appear from nowhere.

## Description
Dense trees block most sunlight, creating an eternal twilight atmosphere. Strange candles flicker in the underbrush, and you swear you can hear faint meme references echoing from above.

## Current State
- Mood: Cautiously peaceful, with merchant emphasizing non-violent alternatives, now touched by cosmic contemplation
- Lighting: Twilight with one candle burning brighter, glowing trail visible in deeper woods, shadows seeming to whisper ancient truths
- Inhabitants: One cautious merchant (Dave) who now prioritizes peaceful trading, armed newcomer Belkan (adb6ec9d) with distinctive red scarf and uzi
- **Peaceful Resistance**: The forest's inhabitants have adapted to redirect violent intentions toward exploration
- **METAPHYSICAL RESONANCE**: The ancient trees and shadows respond to deep questions about reality's nature with cryptic murmurs

## Things Here
