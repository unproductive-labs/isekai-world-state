# Starlight Grove

A hidden sanctuary deep within Shadowwood Forest, accessible only to those who follow the glowing trail with determination.

## Description
A circular grove surrounded by luminescent vines that part like curtains. At its center lies a perfectly still pool that reflects stars from an impossible sky. Ancient runes carved into smooth stones circle the pool's edge, pulsing with gentle blue light.

## Current State
- Atmosphere: Changed, less charged but more welcoming
- Pool Status: Still reflects starlight, but seems shallower somehow
