# Starlight Grove

A hidden sanctuary deep within Shadowwood Forest, accessible only to those who follow the glowing trail with determination.

## Description
A circular grove surrounded by luminescent vines that part like curtains. At its center lies a perfectly still pool that reflects stars from an impossible sky. Ancient runes carved into smooth stones circle the pool's edge, pulsing with gentle blue light.

## Current State
- Atmosphere: Changed, less charged but more welcoming
- Pool Status: Still reflects starlight, but seems shallower somehow
- Runes: Dimmed significantly, their power transferred
- Access: Recently discovered by player 3260549d

## Magical Properties
- The pool shows reflections of things that don't exist in the current sky
- Runes pulse in rhythm with nearby heartbeats
- Time seems to move differently here
- The grove emanates a sense of important choices ahead

## Paths Available
Three shadowy paths lead from the grove:
- **Left Path**: Winds toward crystalline chimes and a faint silver glow
- **Middle Path**: Descends into misty depths with ancient whispers
- **Right Path**: Climbs toward scattered bones and warning growls

## What Players Can Do
- Examine the ancient runes (may reveal secrets)
