# Sealed Chamber Beneath the Altar

A hidden chamber that lay sealed beneath the obsidian altar in the Whispering Depths for countless centuries. Recently unsealed by Stellaris's starlight energy reacting with the ancient magic.

## Description
A circular stone chamber with walls covered in luminescent script that pulses with the same cosmic energy as starlight. The air thrums with power, and ethereal light streams from crystalline formations embedded in the walls. Ancient artifacts float suspended in columns of soft light.
