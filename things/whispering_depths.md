# Whispering Depths

A sunken hollow reached by descending the middle path from Starlight Grove. Thick, luminescent mist swirls here, and ghostly voices speak in forgotten tongues.

## Description
A circular depression in the forest floor, filled with shifting silver mist that glows faintly from within. Ancient stone steps spiral down into the center, where a cracked obsidian altar stands wreathed in whispers. The voices speak of secrets, warnings, and long-lost knowledge.

## Current State
- Atmosphere: Mystical and foreboding
- Mist Status: Active, constantly shifting and glowing
- Altar: Ancient obsidian, cracked down the middle **- CRACK HAS WIDENED significantly**
- **Chamber Below**: The altar's reaction to starlight has unsealed a hidden chamber beneath
- Whispers: Constant murmuring in dead languages **- now speaking of "chosen one" and "seal broken"**
- Access: Just discovered by Stellaris via the middle path

## Magical Properties
- The whispers contain fragments of ancient knowledge
- Those with cosmic awareness might understand pieces of the language
- The altar responds to starlight energy
- Time echoes strangely here - past voices blend with present

## What Players Can Do
