# Whispering Depths

A sunken hollow reached by descending the middle path from Starlight Grove. Thick, luminescent mist swirls here, and ghostly voices speak in forgotten tongues.

## Description
A circular depression in the forest floor, filled with shifting silver mist that glows faintly from within. Ancient stone steps spiral down into the center, where a cracked obsidian altar stands wreathed in whispers. The voices speak of secrets, warnings, and long-lost knowledge.

## Current State
- Atmosphere: Mystical and foreboding
- Mist Status: Active, constantly shifting and glowing
