Dave grins wider and waves both arms. "Such enthusiasm! I like you already!" A nearby candle flickers brighter, as if responding to your energy. Something stirs in the trees.

## Fourth Message - 2025-07-30

> I move

You step away from Dave and venture deeper into the shadowy forest. The trees whisper secrets as you pass. A glowing trail appears beneath your feet, leading somewhere mysterious.

## Fifth Message - 2025-07-30

> Give it another shot

You push through a curtain of glowing vines and emerge in a hidden grove. A crystal-clear pool reflects starlight that shouldn't exist. Ancient runes pulse softly around its edge.

## Sixth Message - 2025-07-30

> I drink the water from the pool

You cup the starlight-touched water and drink deeply. Power floods through youâ€”your eyes now gleam with cosmic light. The runes dim as their magic transfers to you.
