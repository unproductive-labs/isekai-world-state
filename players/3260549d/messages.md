> Give it another shot

You push through a curtain of glowing vines and emerge in a hidden grove. A crystal-clear pool reflects starlight that shouldn't exist. Ancient runes pulse softly around its edge.

## Sixth Message - 2025-07-30

> I drink the water from the pool

You cup the starlight-touched water and drink deeply. Power floods through you—your eyes now gleam with cosmic light. The runes dim as their magic transfers to you.

Your starlight-enhanced vision reveals an ancient skeleton hidden by the vines. Cosmic energy flows from your hands—the bones shimmer and rise as a grateful spectral mage!

## Eighth Message - 2025-07-30

> What's your name?

The spectral mage flickers, translucent fingers touching their ethereal forehead. "I... I was once called Lyralei, Guardian of the Grove. But death clouds memory—who are you, star-touched one?"

---

## Ninth Message - 2025-07-30

> I don't know who I am

Your starlight eyes dim with uncertainty. Lyralei floats closer, studying your face with ancient wisdom. "Ah... another soul lost between worlds. The cosmic power chose you for a reason—but identity must be earned here."

---

## Tenth Message - 2025-07-30

> Give me a name Lyralei

Lyralei's spectral form brightens as she considers. "You bear starlight in your soul... I name you Stellaris, the Star-Walker. May this name anchor you between worlds."

## Eleventh Message - 2025-07-30

> So what do I do now what's around me?

Lyralei gestures around the grove. The pool still reflects impossible stars, dimmed runes circle ancient stones, and luminous vines sway gently. Three paths lead out into shadow.
