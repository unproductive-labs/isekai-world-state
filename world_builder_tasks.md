# World Builder Tasks

## Player Action Context
Player adb6ec9d just arrived in the isekai world with a casual "Yo" greeting - they need to be set up as a new player.

## Tasks to Complete
1. **Create players/adb6ec9d/character.md**: New player arrival, landed in Shadowwood Forest, needs basic character setup
2. **Update world.md**: Increment player count to 2, add new player to statistics
3. **Update things/shadowwood_forest.md**: Add new player presence to current inhabitants

## Files to Edit
- `/app/world_state/players/adb6ec9d/character.md` (CREATE)
- `/app/world_state/world.md`  
- `/app/world_state/things/shadowwood_forest.md`

## Notes
- New player landed in Shadowwood Forest (standard arrival location)
- They're encountering Dave the merchant and the candle altar
- Player count should increase from 1 to 2 in world statistics
- This is their first action, so they start with no special abilities or items
