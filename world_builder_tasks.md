# World Builder Tasks

## Player Action Context
Player adb6ec9d (Belkan) just: Called Stellaris "streaker" and insulted their name, not realizing he's speaking to a cosmically-powered Star-Walker

## Tasks to Complete
1. **Update players/adb6ec9d/character.md**: Add mistaken identity moment and potential cosmic consequence exposure
2. **Update players/3260549d/character.md**: Add reaction to being called wrong name and potential cosmic response to insult
3. **Update things/whispering_depths.md**: Ancient whispers react to disrespect toward the prophesied Star-Walker
4. **Update world.md**: First documented case of player insulting another player's cosmic identity

## Files to Edit
- `/app/world_state/players/adb6ec9d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/players/3260549d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/things/whispering_depths.md`
- `/app/world_state/world.md`

## Notes
Belkan doesn't know Stellaris's real name/title and may have triggered cosmic retribution by insulting the Star-Walker. The enchanted rope and altar chamber may react to this disrespect.
