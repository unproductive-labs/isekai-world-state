# World Builder Tasks

## Player Action Context
Player 3260549d (Stellaris) just: Asked "What is THAT in front of me" while standing at the obsidian altar in Whispering Depths, seeing the newly unsealed chamber below

## Tasks to Complete
1. **Update character**: Add Stellaris's reaction to discovering the sealed chamber - first person to see it in 1000+ years
2. **Update whispering_depths**: Note that Stellaris has now observed the chamber entrance and the whispers are responding to their presence
3. **Prepare chamber encounter**: Set up the chamber for potential exploration - artifacts ready to be examined, cosmic energy building

## Notes
- Stellaris has starlight vision and cosmic awareness, so they can see the chamber clearly and understand some whispers
- The chamber is responding to their presence (artifacts pulsing, energy stirring)
- This is a major discovery moment - first breach in over a millennium
- The whispers are now actively acknowledging Stellaris as the prophesied Star-Walker
