# World Builder Tasks

## Player Action Context  
Player adb6ec9d (Belkan) just used the crystal compass to locate Stellaris (3260549d) who is in the Whispering Depths. Belkan wants to give Stellaris the enchanted rope.

## Tasks to Complete
1. **Update players/adb6ec9d/character.md**: Add compass navigation success, location movement toward Whispering Depths entry
2. **Update things/shadowwood_forest.md**: Note Belkan's departure and compass usage pointing toward underground location  
3. **Update things/whispering_depths.md**: Prepare for second player arrival - Belkan approaching with rope for Stellaris
4. **Consider starlight_grove.md**: Belkan might pass through the grove on way to depths
5. **Update world.md**: Two players about to meet - first player interaction in this world state

## Files to Edit
- `/app/world_state/players/adb6ec9d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/things/shadowwood_forest.md`
- `/app/world_state/things/whispering_depths.md`
- `/app/world_state/things/starlight_grove.md` (if needed)
- `/app/world_state/world.md`

## Notes
- Belkan has the enchanted rope that "moves on its own to help before needed" - this could be significant for helping Stellaris in the depths
- Compass successfully located Stellaris through earth/underground - magical navigation working as intended
- First potential player-to-player interaction in the world state
- Belkan still armed and has full merchant inventory including healing potions that might be useful
