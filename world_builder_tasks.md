# World Builder Tasks

## Player Action Context
Player 3260549d (Stellaris) just asked "What happens" while standing at the obsidian altar in the Whispering Depths.

## Tasks to Complete
1. **Update location**: The obsidian altar has reacted to Stellaris's starlight presence - crack has widened, revealing a glowing chamber beneath
2. **Update character**: Stellaris is now understanding fragments of the ancient whispers due to cosmic awareness ability
3. **Create new area**: Hidden chamber beneath the altar that has been unsealed by starlight energy
4. **Update world state**: The whispers have identified Stellaris as "chosen one" and mentioned a broken seal - this may have broader implications

## Notes
- The altar's reaction suggests Stellaris's starlight powers are key to unlocking ancient mysteries
- The whispers mentioning "seal broken" and "power awakens" hints at larger cosmic events beginning
- Hidden chamber should contain something significant given the dramatic reveal
