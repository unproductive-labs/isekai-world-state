# World Builder Tasks

## Player Action Context
Player adb6ec9d (Belkan) just asked: "lol what do I see. Anything I can shoot at?" - actively looking for combat targets while exploring Shadowwood Forest with his Uzi.

## Tasks to Complete
1. **Update players/adb6ec9d/character.md**: Player is now actively seeking combat/targets, showing aggressive exploration style
2. **Update things/shadowwood_forest.md**: Note tension in the forest as armed newcomer surveys for threats
3. **Consider creature spawns**: Player wants combat - forest could respond with hostile entities
4. **Update world.md**: Armed player seeking conflict could trigger world events

## Files to Edit
- `/app/world_state/players/adb6ec9d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/things/shadowwood_forest.md`
- `/app/world_state/world.md`

## Notes
- Belkan has an Uzi and wants to use it
- Spectral mage Lyralei is present but may not be hostile
- Dave the merchant could be a target or ally
- Forest's magical nature might spawn threats in response to aggressive intent
- Player's combat-seeking behavior should influence world response
