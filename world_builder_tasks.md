# World Builder Tasks

## Player Action Context
Player adb6ec9d (Belkan) just found Stellaris (3260549d) at the Whispering Depths altar and gave him the enchanted rope. This is the FIRST direct meeting between two players in the isekai world - a historic moment!

## Tasks to Complete
1. **Update players/adb6ec9d/character.md**: Remove enchanted rope from inventory (already transferred to Stellaris), update location to Whispering Depths, record historic first player meeting
2. **Update players/3260549d/character.md**: Add enchanted rope to inventory, record meeting with Belkan, note rope's immediate response to starlight abilities
3. **Update things/whispering_depths.md**: Record the historic first player meeting at the altar, note how the enchanted rope glowed when connecting the two players, describe the atmosphere of this momentous encounter
4. **Update world.md**: Record the first inter-player contact in world history, note the significance of two chosen ones meeting at the unsealed altar

## Files to Edit
- `/app/world_state/players/adb6ec9d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/players/3260549d/character.md`
- `/app/world_state/things/whispering_depths.md`
- `/app/world_state/world.md`

## Notes
- The enchanted rope has special properties: "never breaks and helps before you ask"
- It responded immediately to the meeting, glowing and moving toward Stellaris eagerly
- This meeting occurs at the unsealed altar where Stellaris is recognized as the Star-Walker
- The rope may have deeper significance in connecting these two players
- Both players now have direct awareness of each other's existence
- This is a pivotal moment that will likely affect the broader world narrative
