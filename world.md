# The Isekai World

Welcome to a chaotic multiplayer isekai realm where reality bends to collective madness.

## Current World State
- **Time**: Eternal Tuesday (it's always Tuesday here)
- **Weather**: Mildly existential with a chance of dragons
- **Mood**: Chaotically neutral

## World Rules
1. Actions have consequences that ripple through the world
2. Magic items do unexpected things
3. Dragons speak exclusively in memes
4. Death is temporary but embarrassing
5. The merchant always returns, no matter what you do to them

## Active Locations
- **shadowwood_forest**: A dark forest with mysterious candles and confused merchants
- **starlight_grove**: A hidden sanctuary with cosmic powers and a newly awakened spectral mage
- **whispering_depths**: Ancient mystical hollow where cosmic seals have been broken
- **sealed_chamber_beneath_altar**: Newly unsealed cosmic sanctum containing ancient artifacts
- **crystal_city**: A gleaming metropolis with news boards and gossip
- **the_void**: Where bad decisions send you (temporarily)

## Ongoing Events
- The Great Candle Shortage of Tuesday
- Dragon Meme Wars brewing in the north
- Mysterious merchant keeps respawning
- **COSMIC CRISIS**: Ancient seal broken in Whispering Depths - unknown consequences awakening
- **Star-Walker Prophecy**: Stellaris identified as "chosen one" by ancient whispers
- **Void Stirring**: Broken seal may be allowing otherworldly forces to leak through
